# Dawg
An implementation of a classic Subword Graph (also known as Directed Acyclic Word Graph).

Ported from my Haskell version: https://github.com/danielnowakowski/Subword-Graph

Dawg allows you to solve complex string related algorithmic problems in linear time by providing functions for parameterized traversal. For further details please see the examples.
